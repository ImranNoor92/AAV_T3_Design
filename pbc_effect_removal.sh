#This file will be used to write and store codes for removing periodic boundary effects in the molecular dynamics simulation trajectory.
#PBC: defines the boundary conditions of the simulation box, which can introduce artifacts in the trajectory due to molecules crossing box boundaries.
#The gmx trjconv command in GROMACS can be used to remove these artifacts and center the trajectory on the molecule of interest.
#The -pbc mol flag specifies that the periodic boundary conditions should be removed for molecules, and the -center flag centers the molecule in the simulation box.
#This step is important for analyzing and visualizing the trajectory data without artifacts from periodic boundary effects.
